
### Question 1

The point that was new to me is the importance of being mindful of other team members when communicating. 
- For example, instead of bombarding them with many messages, it is better to write down all of your questions and send them as a single message.
- This is because your team members may have their own work to do, and they may not be able to respond to multiple messages immediately.


### Question 2

The area that I think I need to improve on is the ability to work with 100% involvement.
- I sometimes find myself getting distracted by social media or other websites, and I know that this can impact my productivity.
- To make progress in this area, I plan to block social media sites and apps during work hours using a tool like TimeLimit or Freedom.
- I also plan to start tracking my time using an app like Boosted so that I can see where I am spending my time and identify areas where I can improve.

In addition to the above, I also plan to make sure that I am getting enough sleep and exercise, as this will help me to have more energy and focus throughout the day. I also plan to eat healthy foods to avoid feeling sluggish.
