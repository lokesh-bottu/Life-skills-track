## What does the OSI Model means?

OSI Model means Open System Interconnection Model. This mainly states that how the data is tranferred from one to one via internet. This OSI model was introduced in 1984.

## Why do we need OSI Model?

Before the OSI model is introduced the data is transferred using LAN cable, but this doesn't works in every situation. For example, one person uses Windows OS and the other uses Linux, or any other OS. So, to overcome this issue OSI model is introduced by  by ISO (Internation Standard Organization).

## How does the OSI Model works?

Basically this model is divided into 7 layers which includes Application Layer, Presentation Layer, Session Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, Datalink Layer, and Physical Layer.
Firstly data is transferred from Application to Physical one by one and then it is sent to the user through internet.

### Application Layer

Application Layer provides services for application which works by internet, with the help of application protocols like HTTPS Protocols, NFS, IRC etc.. to do web surfing. These protocols collectives make an Application Layer, and are used to File transfer, email etc.

### Presentation Layer

Here, the data is received from Application layer. The data is stored in form of numbers and characters. Buy as the computer doesn't understands the human language so it is converted to binary language.
Now this Presentation Layer reduces the number of bits used by the data which makes the data transmission faster. Also the data is encrypted from the senders end and decrypted at the receiver's end and for this Secure Sockets Layer is used.

### Session Layer
