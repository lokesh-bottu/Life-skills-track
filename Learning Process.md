# Learning Process

### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
- Feyman's technique mainly says that the more we explain the topic to others  the better understanding we get.
- If we dont understand a particular topic then firstly explain it to someone else.

		
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- I liked the story of Dali that he will hold the keys when he is too much stressed of solving the problems and getting waked up by his pet when he is relaxed.
- I liked the way he worked on his ideas about the focused mode and diffused mode, from this I learnt that whenever we are learning something new and we got stuck somewhere then do not get demotivated get relaxed for sometime.
- Meanwhile you would be getting some ideas of the problem where you got stuck , then get back again and solve the problem


### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
-	Active Mode
	In this mode we will be focused more may be while learning something new. 
	may be when we  are listening to something surprising and curious.
	
-	Diffuse Mode
  In this mode we will be idle without any feelings most probably.
	This may be while sleeping, while just sitting and enjoying by seeing the nature around us, while talking to friends.
	
### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- Write down the topic name and do some research about it 
- Then try to explain the concept in our own language 
- Then try to identify the challenges faced during the work and try to resolve it 
- Then try to solve the same problems in more optistic way and quickly, practice more and more.
	

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- I will do my important work in the very morning, I wont do any unnecessary things in between my work because I might get distracted.
- I will get relaxed for sometime when I get stuck in somepart of leaning process.
